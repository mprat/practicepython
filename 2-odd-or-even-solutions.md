## [Exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/01/exercise-2-odd-or-even.html)

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 

_Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?_

Extras: 

1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message. 
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it `num`) and one number to divide by (`check`). If `check` divides evenly into `num`, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
