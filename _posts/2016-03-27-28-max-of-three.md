## Exercise {{ page.number }}

Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three. Do this without using the Python `max()` function!

The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that Python normally takes care of for us. All you need is some variables and `if` statements!

Happy Coding!
